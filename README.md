# Master-Oogway
The wisest of senseis whos wisdom knows no bounds within analyzing the human emotion within the psychosphere


# How to Use
The Oogway bot is a very simple piece of technology which can be accessed by going to our [site](https://cocalc19.ai-camp.dev/06032c1d-d4db-48d7-a50a-4df202337c6d/port/11420/index.html). 
The bot takes in a piece of text from the user and then using a pretrained model with [aitextgen](https://docs.aitextgen.io/) is able to detect the emotion of the text and provide sage advice for the user based on their current emotion.
